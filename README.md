BDDCucumberProjectnopCommerceAdmin

This project is a Cucumber BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) project that focuses on performing basic login and customer search functionality using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. The project includes two feature files, one with multiple scenarios and another with a data table. All the necessary steps are defined in two step definition classes. The project is publicly available as a repository and utilizes Selenium and Cucumber Pretty Report.
Features

The project includes the following features:

    Login Functionality: Allows users to log in to the nopCommerce admin panel.
    Customer Search: Enables users to search for customers based on various parameters.

Design Pattern

The project utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which provides a structured approach to organizing test automation code. The POM design pattern separates the web elements and their interactions into separate classes, enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and readability.
Feature Files

The project contains the following feature files:

    Multiple Scenarios: This feature file includes multiple scenarios that cover various aspects of the login and customer search functionality.
    Data Table: The data table feature file demonstrates how to use a data table in Cucumber to test different inputs and expected outcomes.

Step Definition Classes

The project includes two step definition classes:

    LoginSteps: This step definition class contains the step definitions related to the login functionality, such as entering credentials and verifying successful login.
    CustomerSearchSteps: The step definitions in this class handle the customer search functionality, including searching by name, email, and role.

Reporting

The project utilizes the Selenium Cucumber Pretty Report for generating test execution reports. This reporting framework provides comprehensive and visually appealing reports to analyze the test results.
